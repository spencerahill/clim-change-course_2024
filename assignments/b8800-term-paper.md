# Term paper for B8800 section

:::{warning}
The term paper is **only** for those students enrolled in the course as EAS B8800.  For those of you enrolled in EAS 48800 or SUS 7300B, this is **not** required.

## Overview: literature review on a climate dynamics topic of your choice
In this paper, you will summarize the state of understanding of some topic within the broad umbrella of climate science, based on a close reading of at least ten published peer-reviewed scientific articles on that topic.

The topic needs to be (at least predominantly) **hard science** as opposed to, say, climate policy, climate justice, climate economics, etc.

Motivation: one of the single most important skills in science is the ability to effectively synthesize the contents of many technical articles into a coherent picture of what is understood and what remains open regarding the given topic.  (In fact, that's probably true of most *knowledge professions*, including law, medicine, and engineering as well.) 

A *literature review*, wherein you read widely on the topic and then synthesize your findings into your own written summary, is a great way to do that.  It forces you to read widely about the topic and, in developing your thoughts on that reading into written prose, organizing and tightening your understanding.

This should be about something that *you* particularly want to learn more about.  That said, for inspiration some example potential topics are:

- Polar-amplified warming
- Climate sensitivity vs. Earth-system sensitivity
- The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and climate
- How has the Montreal Protocol influenced global temperatures?
- How do aerosols influence deep convective clouds?
- Physically, how would Solar Radiation Management geoengineering work?
- Role of land-use and land-cover change in climate change
- Atmospheric circulations on other terrestrial planets
- How ocean biological processes are incorporated into climate models

## On incorporating your own data analysis
Since this is a *literature review*, it is **not** required to do any data analysis of your own.  But, if you really want to, we can discuss it and decide together if it's in scope.  But even if you include your own data analysis, the paper should still primarily be a review.

## Expectations
### Length
The final submitted paper will be ~10-15 pages (not including the bibliography), double-spaced.

The 10-15 page range is only a guideline: more important than the exact length is how clearly you convey your scientific story.  If you can do that in, say, 8 pages, that's great.  (As the [adage](https://www.quora.com/Who-wrote-the-quote-If-I-had-more-time-I-would-have-written-you-a-shorter-letter) goes, "Sorry I wrote you a long [review paper]; I didn't have time to write you a shorter one.")

Or, especially if you include multiple large figures, perhaps you'll end up needing, say, 18 pages.

### Formatting
For citations and bibliography, there is no particular required style (MLM, APA, etc.).  Pick one, and use it consistently.

In addition to being double-spaced, keep all other formatting (font, margins, etc.) standard-ish.  I'd rather have it go to e.g. a 16th page with ample margins and a 11 or 12-pt font rather than it being squished into 15 pages.

### How to submit
My preference is for you to submit the final paper and intermediate steps as [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) files, shared with me via [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

That said, I will also accept Word, Pages, or PDF files.  You can email them as attachments or share them with me via Google Drive...just use the Google Drive associated with your CUNY "citymail" email account, and share it with my email address that's on the syllabus.

## Timeline

- By **Friday, February 16th, 2024**: submit topic proposal (title and 1-2 sentence summary)
- By **Friday, March 1st, 2024**: submit annotated list of 5 identified papers (1 sentence each summarizing what you expect it to cover).
- By **Friday, April 5th, 2024**: having read your 5 approved papers, submit draft title, abstract, and 5 additional papers.
- By **Friday, May 3rd, 2024**: submit complete (but rough) draft.
- Final deadline: **TBD** (awaiting CCNY announcement of final exam dates)
