## Course Description
This class introduces you to modern climate science.  We'll explore questions like: What does *climate* mean?  What *is* Earth's climate now?  What controls it?  What was it like in Earth's past, and why?  What is it likely to do in the future?  How do human activities influence it?  Answering them requires multiple scientific approaches including meteorology, physical oceanography, hydrology, atmospheric chemistry, ocean biogeochemistry, and ecology.  Climate science relies on incredibly complicated and powerful tools such as a satellite-based observational network and supercomputer-run climate models---but this class will emphasize simple models and conceptual understanding: how we can understand many fundamental aspects of the incredibly complex climate system on a chalkboard via remarkably elegant and simple frameworks.

## Grading
There is no pre-set distribution of grades or "curve" across the class: you are **not** competing against your classmates.

For those enrolled in this class as EAS 48800 or SUS 7300B, this course is 3 credits.  For those enrolled in B8800, it is 4 credits, with the 4th credit coming through a term paper whose requirements will be covered elsewhere.

The grading breakdown is listed below.  Participation is determined by your attendance, attentiveness, and engagement during class.  Attending class is crucial!  Lectures will not generally be recorded or zoomed, because as much as possible we'll be working at the blackboard rather than from slides.

Details on the homework assignments, exams, and (for B8800 only) term paper will be announced.

## Academic Integrity
I encourage you to use ChatGPT **as a tool to advance your learning, not as a crutch**.  You simply will not learn the material if you uncritically ask ChatGPT to do your assignments for you---and your exam scores will reflect that.  But it is possible to use in a way that helps you really understand the material.  More generally: don't cheat.  You are required to follow CCNY's [Community Standards](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/studentaffairs/community-standards) and the [CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity](http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-resources/academic-integrity-policy/).
