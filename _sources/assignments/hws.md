## HW1, Hartmann Ch. 1, due Feb. 15th 9:30am

- **Questions 1-4**: Questions 1-4 in Hartmann Ch. 1
- **Question 5**: Write out the full derivation of the scale height as we did in class.  (Note: this is roughly as complicated as the math will get throughout the course, at least in terms of derivations we'll go through carefully and that you're expected to follow.)

## HW2, Hartmann Ch. 2, due March 5th 9:30am

- **Questions 2-5 in Hartmann Ch. 2**

## HW3, Hartmann Ch. 4 and 5, due March 28th **11:59pm**
(In order, these are **slightly modified** versions of Question 1, Ch. 4 and Questions 1-3, Ch. 5 of the textbook):

1. If the top 75 m of ocean warms by 8°C during a 3-month summer period, what is the average rate of net energy flow into the ocean during this period in units of W m$^{−2}$?  If the atmosphere warms by 25°C during the same period, what is the average rate of net energy flow into the atmosphere?
2. The approximate volume of water retained in soil moisture and groundwater is given in Table 5.1 of the textbook (also available on the lecture slides). Use the data in Fig. 5.1 from the book (also available on the lecture slides) to calculate the time it would take for precipitation over land to deliver an amount of water equal to the soil water and groundwater.  How long would it take to replace the groundwater and soil moisture if only 15% of the runoff could be redirected to replenishing the groundwater?
3. Use the bulk aerodynamic formula (4.32) to calculate the evaporation rate from the ocean, assuming that $C_{DE}=11^{–3}$, $U=4$ m s$^{–1}$, the air density is 1.2 kg m$^{–3}$, and that the reference-level air temperature is always 2.2°C less than the sea surface temperature.  Calculate the evaporation rate for the following values of $T_s$, $q$, and RH, and then answer: how would you evaluate the importance of relative humidity versus the importance of surface temperature for determining the evaporation rate?
    1. $T_s=0$°C, $q_s^*=4.0$ g kg$^{−1}$, RH=50% 
    2. $T_s=0$°C, $q_s^*=4.0$ g kg$^{−1}$, RH=100% 
    3. $T_s=30$°C, $q_s^*=28$ g kg$^{−1}$, RH=50% 
    4. $T_s=30$°C, $q_s^*=28$ g kg$^{−1}$, RH=100%
4. Calculate the Bowen ratio using the bulk aerodynamic formulas for surface temperatures of 0, 14, and 28°C, if the relative humidity of the air at the reference level is 75% and the air–sea temperature difference is 1.8°C.  Assume that the transfer coefficients for heat and moisture are equal.
