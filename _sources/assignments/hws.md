# Homework assignments

## HW1, Hartmann Ch. 1, due Feb. 15th

- **Questions 1-4**: Questions 1-4 in Hartmann Ch. 1
- **Question 5**: Write out the full derivation of the scale height as we did in class.  (Note: this is roughly as complicated as the math will get throughout the course, at least in terms of derivations we'll go through carefully and that you're expected to follow.)
